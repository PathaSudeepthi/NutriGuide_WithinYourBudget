# NutriGuide_WithinYourBudget
🌱 Nutrition Coach App

Empowering low-income families to eat healthier within their budget

📌 Problem Statement

Malnutrition and unhealthy diets are major global health challenges.

Low-income families often depend on cheap, calorie-heavy but nutrient-poor foods.

Community nutrition programs struggle to offer affordable, culturally relevant meal plans.

Existing healthy eating apps often ignore local food culture, food availability, and budget constraints.
